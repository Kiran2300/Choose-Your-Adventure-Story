# Choose Your Own Adventure

You find yourself standing at the edge of a mysterious forest. The trees are thick and tall, and a fog covers the path ahead. The air is cool, and you can hear distant noises that might be animalsâ€”or something else entirely.

As you consider your options, you notice a narrow path leading deeper into the forest and a faint, glowing light coming from a distance.
